## Introduction

This repository showcases various Python examples and exercises related to important software development principles. Each exercise focuses on different aspects of Python, such as writing reusable functions, working with flow control, handling data structures, writing tests, and using AI tools in software development.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/python-course-work.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd python-course-work
    ```
3. Install any necessary dependencies (if any).

## Exercises

### 1. Functions and Reusability

In this section, you will find Python examples related to creating reusable functions and building modular applications. It covers:
- Defining functions.
- Using parameters and return values.
- Working with local and global variables.

Example: `functions.py`

### 2. Flow Control

This section includes Python examples demonstrating flow control using `if` statements, `for` and `while` loops, and control flow statements like `break` and `continue`. It covers:
- Writing loops and conditions.
- Handling prime numbers and guessing games.
- Using nested loops.

Example: `flow_control.py`

### 3. Working with Data Collections

In this section, you'll explore different data collections in Python, including lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries. You'll learn how to:
- Create, update, and manipulate lists.
- Perform operations on sets and dictionaries.

Example: `data_collections.py`

### 4. Testing in Python

This section contains examples of unit tests written using the `unittest` module. It demonstrates:
- Writing unit tests for functions.
- Testing for expected exceptions.
- Following the Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach.

Example: `test_math_functions.py`


## Running the Tests

To run the unit tests included in the repository:

1. Navigate to the tests directory or where the test files are located.
2. Run the tests using Python's `unittest`:
    ```bash
    python -m unittest test_math_functions.py
    ```

This command will execute all the test cases written in the `test_math_functions.py` file.
