def greet(): 
    name = input("What is your name? ") 
    print(f"Hello {name}") 

greet() 
'''

'''
It is better to ask for the input outside of the function call and remove the input instruction from the definition:
'''

def greet(name):
    return f"Hello {name}"

# name = input("What is your name? ")
# print(greet(name))


# Default Values 

def mon_spend (salary, spend): 
    total = salary - spend 
    return total 

mon_spend (2000, 136) 


'''
But what if your salary is the same every month? You can include a default value for an argument in your definition,
that is used if no value is given when the function is called:
 '''

def mon_spend (spend, salary=2000): 
    total = salary - spend 
    return total 

feb = mon_spend (136) 
print(f"Feb savings total: £{feb}")

'''
If you are using default values, the order of arguments is important.
See what happens when you switch default value first in the definition and call the function,
 as in the example below: 
'''

'''
def mon_spend (salary=2000, spend): 
    total = salary - spend 
    return total 

mon_spend (136) 
print(f"Feb savings total: £{feb}")

capital_city(city = "Madrid", country = "Spain")
