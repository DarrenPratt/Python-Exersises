#You can also chain comparators in a conditional. In the example below, 
# the conditional checks two comparators: whether a deposit is greater than 0 but not above a maximum deposit amount:

deposit = 15

if 0 < deposit <= 100:

    print(f"Thank you for the Â£{deposit} deposit!")

else:

    print("This is not a valid amount to deposit.")
